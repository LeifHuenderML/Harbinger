November 10-23
- updated the data prep script for valley forecast to make it so that the data is split by years
- created 2 new datasets one where there it no training augmentation train2 and one where there is but the years ares split accordingly train3
- retrained the models
- went through the entire paper and changed everything to the naming convention they wanted
- added a section in future research directions to discuss Investigating CM underdiagnosis patterns through integration of demographic and health data, particularly focusing on vulnerable populations (e.g., AIDS and cancer patients) who typically present more severe symptoms. This analysis could help quantify reporting bias and develop correction factors for incidence predictions in underserved communities, ultimately improving model accuracy across diverse populations
- Removed "[cite Beck and another paper that uses blocking for llms]" on page 8 paragraph 4. 
- addressed this concern 
    2. The validation RMSE is notably lower than the test RMSE, raising questions about the proposed model's true performance.
     Additional discussion and analysis on this discrepancy would strengthen the evaluation.
    The concern about the discrepancy between validation and test RMSE has been addressed through two additions to the paper:
    1.	A comprehensive analysis of the validation-test performance gap was added to Section 4.1 (Model Performance Metrics), paragraph 4, page 12:
    "It's worth noting that while the xLSTM performed best on both validation and test sets, there's a significant 
    difference between its validation RMSE (68.33) and test RMSE (273.78). This large gap, common across all models 
    but particularly pronounced in the more complex architectures, can be attributed to several factors. First, the 
    temporal nature of the data means weather patterns and cocci incidence relationships may evolve over time, 
    making generalization challenging. Second, the test set may contain more extreme or unusual cases than the 
    validation set. Third, despite our regularization efforts, the models' capacity to memorize training patterns 
    may be leading to overfitting. The simpler MLP model shows more consistent performance between validation 
    and test sets, which could indicate better generalization despite not achieving the lowest validation RMSE, suggesting that model complexity plays a significant role in the size of this performance gap."
    2.	The future research directions in Section 5 were improved with a more detailed point addressing
     validation frameworks (item 8, page 14):
    "8. Implementing sophisticated validation frameworks, including temporal-aware cross-validation techniques, 
    ensemble methods combining complementary architectures, and enhanced regularization approaches to address 
    the observed validation-test performance gap and improve model generalization."
