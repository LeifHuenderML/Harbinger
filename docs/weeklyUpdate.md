- went through and made more edits to the imci grant
- came up with a list of names that might be more fitting for our model
- went through the pesticides dataset and there are over 1200 unique pesticides, including the valuues of measurements made it would expand our dataset by almost 4000 columns
- should we only include relevant ones that have been studied, i can make multiple final datasets with one that includes it and one that doesnt too
- wrote the transcript for the research gate video
- wrote up a complimentary document for the research gate video


November 10-23
- updated the data prep script for valley forecast to make it so that the data is split by years
- created 2 new datasets one where there it no training augmentation train2 and one where there is but the years ares split accordingly train3
- retrained the models
- went through the entire paper and changed everything to the naming convention they wanted
- added a section in future research directions to discuss Investigating CM underdiagnosis patterns through integration of demographic and health data, particularly focusing on vulnerable populations (e.g., AIDS and cancer patients) who typically present more severe symptoms. This analysis could help quantify reporting bias and develop correction factors for incidence predictions in underserved communities, ultimately improving model accuracy across diverse populations
- Removed "[cite Beck and another paper that uses blocking for llms]" on page 8 paragraph 4. 
- addressed this concern 
    2. The validation RMSE is notably lower than the test RMSE, raising questions about the proposed model's true performance.
     Additional discussion and analysis on this discrepancy would strengthen the evaluation.
    The concern about the discrepancy between validation and test RMSE has been addressed through two additions to the paper:
    1.	A comprehensive analysis of the validation-test performance gap was added to Section 4.1 (Model Performance Metrics), paragraph 4, page 12:
    "It's worth noting that while the xLSTM performed best on both validation and test sets, there's a significant 
    difference between its validation RMSE (68.33) and test RMSE (273.78). This large gap, common across all models 
    but particularly pronounced in the more complex architectures, can be attributed to several factors. First, the 
    temporal nature of the data means weather patterns and cocci incidence relationships may evolve over time, 
    making generalization challenging. Second, the test set may contain more extreme or unusual cases than the 
    validation set. Third, despite our regularization efforts, the models' capacity to memorize training patterns 
    may be leading to overfitting. The simpler MLP model shows more consistent performance between validation 
    and test sets, which could indicate better generalization despite not achieving the lowest validation RMSE, suggesting that model complexity plays a significant role in the size of this performance gap."
    2.	The future research directions in Section 5 were improved with a more detailed point addressing
     validation frameworks (item 8, page 14):
    "8. Implementing sophisticated validation frameworks, including temporal-aware cross-validation techniques, 
    ensemble methods combining complementary architectures, and enhanced regularization approaches to address 
    the observed validation-test performance gap and improve model generalization."
- finished the paper and resubmit for publication

December 8 - January 8
- updated readme to be more accurate with the projects current status
- created a readme file in dataprocessing so that there is more information on what all the build scripts are doing
- updated the reformat_arizona_met_dataset.py to no longer save multiple output files. it didnt make any sense because we only really need the years that match the output data and i was saving  versions with years beyond the output data. 
- added a lot of documentation to the data processing page
- recieved the changes that needed to be made to the paper
- went through and made all the subsequent edits
- updated the manuscript upload
- updated the marked manuscript upload
- updated the response to reviews
- added more documentation to the data preprocessing
- ended up removing 4 scripts that were being used to preprocess data that ended up not being very helpful
- had an idea to try and find the top correlative chemical usages spent some time working on it got these results
