# Harbinger: Advanced Deep Learning for Valley Fever Prediction and Risk Assessment

## Cover Letter

Dear IMCI Director Holly Wichman,

I am submitting this white paper for consideration under the IMCI Request for White Papers. As the principal investigator of the Harbinger project, I confirm my eligibility as an early career faculty member. I have not previously been a PI/PD on an external, peer-reviewed research project grant or program project grant from either Federal or non-Federal sources.

The Harbinger project builds upon our previous work, Valley Forecast, which demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) incidence. This proposal aims to expand and refine our approach, leveraging more advanced modeling techniques and incorporating additional data sources to improve predictive accuracy and develop comprehensive risk assessment tools.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

The Harbinger project aims to revolutionize the prediction and risk assessment of Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) outbreaks through the application of cutting-edge deep learning techniques and comprehensive environmental data analysis. Building upon our previous Valley Forecast research, which demonstrated the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in predicting Valley Fever incidence, Harbinger seeks to significantly advance our predictive capabilities and develop robust risk assessment tools that can inform public health strategies in endemic regions.

Our central hypothesis posits that by leveraging more sophisticated deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and Mamba models, and incorporating a broader range of environmental and epidemiological data, we can achieve a step-change improvement in the accuracy of Valley Fever outbreak predictions. This hypothesis is grounded in the success of our previous work and the recent advancements in deep learning that have shown promise in capturing complex, long-term dependencies in time-series data.

The significance of this research cannot be overstated. Valley Fever poses a substantial public health challenge in endemic regions, with increasing incidence rates and a considerable economic burden. Our previous work demonstrated a correlation between temporal microclimatic variations and regional Valley Fever incidences, with the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) model achieving a 49.13% reduction in prediction error compared to baseline methods. Harbinger aims to build upon this foundation, creating more accurate and actionable predictive models that can directly impact public health strategies, resource allocation, and early intervention efforts.

Our approach to achieving these goals is multifaceted and interdisciplinary. First, we will significantly expand our data sources, extending geographical coverage to include more counties in California and Arizona, and incorporating additional environmental factors such as soil composition, air quality indices, and human activity patterns. This expanded dataset will provide a more comprehensive view of the complex interactions that influence Valley Fever incidence.

Second, we will implement and compare advanced deep learning architectures, including Transformer and Mamba models, against our previous LSTM and xLSTM implementations. These newer architectures have shown remarkable performance in various sequence modeling tasks and may offer improved capacity to capture the intricate temporal dependencies in our data. We will also explore ensemble methods to leverage the strengths of multiple model types, potentially leading to more robust predictions.

Third, Harbinger will develop a sophisticated risk assessment framework using Monte Carlo simulations and Markov chain models. This will allow us to quantify prediction uncertainties and develop interpretable risk scores and confidence intervals for different regions and timeframes. Such a tool will be invaluable for public health officials in assessing the likelihood and potential severity of Valley Fever outbreaks.

A key focus of our research will be enhancing model explainability. We will implement advanced techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation to provide insights into the decision-making processes of our models. This will not only improve trust in the model outputs but also contribute to our understanding of the environmental factors most critically influencing Valley Fever incidence.

To address the overfitting concerns observed in our previous work, we will implement rigorous cross-validation techniques and conduct extensive sensitivity analyses. These steps will ensure the robustness of our models across various environmental scenarios and data perturbations, leading to more reliable and generalizable predictions.

Finally, we will apply the Qualitative Associative Rule Mining (QUARM) algorithm, developed by our research group at the University of Idaho, to uncover novel correlations between environmental factors and Valley Fever incidence. This innovative approach has the potential to reveal previously unknown relationships in our complex dataset, further enhancing our predictive capabilities and contributing to the broader understanding of environmental influences on disease dynamics.

By integrating these advanced techniques and expanded datasets, the Harbinger project aims to create a comprehensive, accurate, and interpretable system for Valley Fever prediction and risk assessment. This work has the potential to significantly impact public health strategies in endemic regions and provide a framework for addressing other environmentally influenced diseases. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of this research, combining expertise in computer science, epidemiology, and environmental science, aligns perfectly with IMCI's mission to foster collaboration across diverse fields in tackling complex biological challenges.
