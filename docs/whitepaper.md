# Harbinger and QUARM: Advanced Deep Learning and Qualitative Analysis for Valley Fever Prediction and Risk Assessment

## Cover Letter

Dear IMCI Director Holly Wichman,

I am submitting this white paper for consideration under the IMCI Request for White Papers. As the principal investigator of the Harbinger project, I confirm my eligibility as an early career faculty member. I have not previously been a PI/PD on an external, peer-reviewed research project grant or program project grant from either Federal or non-Federal sources.

The Harbinger project builds upon our previous work, Valley Forecast, which demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) incidence. This proposal aims to expand and refine our approach, leveraging more advanced modeling techniques and incorporating additional data sources to improve predictive accuracy and develop comprehensive risk assessment tools.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
John Shovic
Director of the Center for Intelligent Industrial Robotics

The Harbinger project, in conjunction with our Qualitative Associative Rule Mining (QUARM) algorithm, aims to revolutionize the prediction and risk assessment of Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) outbreaks. This integrated approach combines cutting edge deep learning techniques with qualitative data analysis to strengthen our understanding and predictive capabilities for Valley Fever incidence.

Our central hypothesis is twofold:
1. By leveraging sophisticated deep learning architectures and incorporating a broad range of environmental and epidemiological data, we can significantly improve the accuracy of Valley Fever outbreak predictions.
2. Through the application of QUARM, we can uncover novel, qualitative relationships between environmental factors and Valley Fever incidence, complementing and enhancing our quantitative predictions.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to address the substantial public health challenge posed by Valley Fever in endemic regions. Our previous work with Valley Forecast demonstrated promising results, and now we aim to create a more comprehensive and nuanced approach by integrating advanced deep learning with qualitative analysis.

### Harbinger: Advanced Deep Learning Approach

Harbinger will build upon our previous success with LSTM models by implementing and comparing advanced architectures such as Transformer and Mamba models. These newer architectures have shown remarkable performance in sequence modeling tasks and may offer improved capacity to capture intricate temporal dependencies in our data.

Key aspects of the Harbinger approach include:

1. Expanding data sources to include more counties and additional environmental factors.
2. Implementing and comparing advanced deep learning architectures.
3. Developing a sophisticated risk assessment framework using Monte Carlo simulations and Markov chain models.
4. Enhancing model explainability through techniques like SHAP values and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation.
5. Addressing overfitting concerns through rigorous cross-validation and sensitivity analyses.

### QUARM: Qualitative Associative Rule Mining

In parallel with Harbinger's quantitative approach, we will apply our innovative QUARM algorithm to uncover qualitative relationships within our dataset. The QUARM variant we will be using, developed by our research group at the University of Idaho, offers a unique perspective on data analysis that complements traditional machine learning techniques.

Key aspects of the QUARM approach include:

1. Identifying qualitative associations between environmental factors and Valley Fever incidence.
2. Uncovering non-linear and potentially counterintuitive relationships that may be missed by quantitative methods.
3. Generating human-interpretable rules that can provide insights to domain experts and policymakers.
4. Exploring temporal and spatial patterns in qualitative associations.
5. Integrating QUARM findings with Harbinger's deep learning models to create a more comprehensive predictive framework.

The QUARM algorithm works by discretizing continuous variables and then searching for significant associations between these discretized variables. It can handle high-dimensional data and is particularly adept at finding complex, multi-variable associations. This makes it ideal for exploring the intricate relationships between various environmental factors and Valley Fever incidence.

### Integration of Harbinger and QUARM

The true power of our approach lies in the integration of Harbinger's deep learning capabilities with QUARM's qualitative insights. This integration will be achieved through several mechanisms:

1. Using QUARM-derived rules to inform feature engineering for Harbinger's deep learning models.
2. Incorporating QUARM associations as additional inputs or attention mechanisms in our neural network architectures.
3. Validating and refining Harbinger's predictions using QUARM's qualitative insights.
4. Developing a hybrid risk assessment framework that combines quantitative predictions with qualitative risk factors.

By combining these approaches, we aim to create a system that not only provides accurate predictions but also offers interpretable insights into the underlying factors influencing Valley Fever incidence. This dual approach has the potential to significantly impact public health strategies in endemic regions and provide a framework for addressing other environmentally influenced diseases.

The interdisciplinary nature of this research, combining expertise in computer science, epidemiology, environmental science, and qualitative data analysis, aligns perfectly with IMCI's mission to foster collaboration across diverse fields in tackling complex biological challenges. Through the synergistic application of Harbinger and QUARM, we believe we can make significant strides in understanding, predicting, and ultimately mitigating the impact of Valley Fever.
